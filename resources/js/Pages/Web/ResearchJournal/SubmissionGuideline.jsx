            Authors are required to submit their manuscripts through our
            official website by creating and registering an account. Upon
            registration, authors will gain access to their personal dashboard,
            where they can submit new manuscripts, monitor the review process,
            and track the status of their submissions. All manuscripts must be
            original, unpublished, and not under consideration elsewhere.
            Submissions should be prepared according to the journalâ€™s formatting
            and referencing guidelines, which are available on the website.
            Authors are encouraged to carefully review and adhere to these
            guidelines to ensure a smooth review process. The journal follows a
            strict double-blind peer-review system, and all accepted articles
            will be published open access.
