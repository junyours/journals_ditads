            We adhere to a strict double-blind review process, ensuring that the
            identities of both authors and reviewers remain confidential.
            Submissions that do not meet the basic standards will be promptly
            rejected, and the authors will be notified of the decision. If a
            manuscript meets the initial criteria, the editors will assign two
            or more reviewers to conduct a detailed evaluation. Based on the
            reviewers' feedback, the editors may recommend revisions before the
            article can be accepted for publication. Final acceptance is
            contingent upon the author making the necessary modifications in
            accordance with the reviewers’ and editors’ recommendations.
