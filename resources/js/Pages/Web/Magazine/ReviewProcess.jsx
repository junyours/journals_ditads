                Once submitted, the article will first be reviewed by the
                assigned Associate Editor to ensure it follows the prescribed
                basic format. It will then undergo a comprehensive plagiarism
                check. After this, the article will be sent for peer review,
                typically completed within one week (though the timeframe may
                vary depending on the article’s type and complexity). Following
                the review, the authors will receive an email from the Editor
                containing the final decision, based on the Associate Editor’s
                recommendation and the approval of the Editor-in-Chief.

                Throughout the review process, both the author(s) and
                reviewer(s) remain anonymous, except in cases where the article
                explicitly requires identification of individuals involved.
                Unless an exception applies, the Editor will remove any
                identifying information, such as author affiliations, to
                maintain anonymity.
