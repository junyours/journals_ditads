                <p className="text-justify">
                    Neilson and Wilson made up the name zas Digital Institute
                    Training and Development Services (DIT.ADS) on June 19,
                    2019. The concept of the business started when Neilson, the
                    son, and Wilson, the father attended the Seminar on Research
                    held at Davao City. The two (Neilson and Wilson) together
                    with the support of the family members envisioned to help
                    the students and teachers in the city of Cagayan de Oro and
                    those who find difficulty in engaging research especially
                    when a research paper required the use of descriptive and
                    inferential statistical tools. The pioneered also
                    anticipated that in the coming years digital training for
                    research will be in demand and could be easily learned by
                    anybody interested in research through the use of
                    Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software.
                    SPSS is software for editing and analyzing all sorts of
                    data. The pioneering leaders of the business firmly believed
                    in the concept that “Research and development (R&D) is a
                    valuable tool for growing and improving the individual and
                    the business. R&D involves researching the market and the
                    customer needs and developing new and improved products and
                    services to fit these needs. Businesses that have an R&D
                    strategy have a greater chance of success than businesses
                    that don’t. An R&D strategy can lead to innovation and
                    increased productivity and can boost the business’s
                    competitive advantage.”
